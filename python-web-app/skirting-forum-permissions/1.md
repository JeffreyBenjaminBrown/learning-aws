My changes to the Apache config are [here](https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/learning-aws/blob/48d7e0bf8ecae1ae1123b2ad6bff4651d2c8bc8c/python-web-app/apache/apache2.conf#L230-L259). (I'll break that out into a separate file under mods-enabled/ once it works.)

Here's the [static data folder](https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/learning-aws/tree/48d7e0bf8ecae1ae1123b2ad6bff4651d2c8bc8c/python-web-app/polls/static), which I can access. The parent of that folder is the "polls" app that I can't access.
